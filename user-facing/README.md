# Installation

Copy the "christmas" directory to your user-facing website, so that you'll be able to access it under `DOMAIN/christmas/`. For example, mine is at `http://arul.mobi/christmas/`.

## Different URL?

In index.html, instead of "/christmas/", if you use a different URL, change the JavaScript code on line 36

## PHP

You'll obviously need PHP to run the script `changecolour.php`.

## Set IP Address to your home IP Address

Open `changecolour.php` and change line 15 to reflect your home IP address, and if necessary port number.
